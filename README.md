# simple-budget-tool
This is a simple tool, which shows for any amount of money how much â‚¬ you can spend each day/week until the next cash comes in. No server or anything else is needed to make it work except a browser and a connection to the internet.

Just download the HTML file, open it in a browser and let the tool calculate your personal budget.
